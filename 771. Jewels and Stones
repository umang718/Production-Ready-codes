771. Jewels and Stones

Problem Description :

You're given strings jewels representing the types of stones that are jewels, and stones representing the stones you have. Each character in stones is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".


Solution :

int numJewelsInStones(string jewels, string stones) 
{
    vector<int> characters(128, 0);
    int res = 0;        
    for (char& c : jewels) 
        characters[c]++;
    for (char& c : stones) 
        if(characters[c]) 
            res++; 
    return res;

}


TC : O(M+N) 
M = length of jewels
N = length of stones
