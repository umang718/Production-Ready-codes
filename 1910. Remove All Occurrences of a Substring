1910. Remove All Occurrences of a Substring

Problem Description :

Given two strings s and part, perform the following operation on s until all occurrences of the substring part are removed:

Find the leftmost occurrence of the substring part and remove it from s.
Return s after removing all occurrences of part.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters in a string.

Solution :

string removeOccurrences(string s, string part) 
{

    while(s.size()!=0 && s.find(part)<=s.size()-1)
    {
        s.erase(s.find(part),part.size());
    }
    return s;

}
